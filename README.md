testing the odyssey website

The idea: we write our stuff in markdown (easy), then we use Pelican to generate the html files for us (see "output").

Pelican uses themes to generate the structure of our website. To modify themes slightly, usually change the css file.

DO not edit the html output files. Each page share the same layout and everything. Edit layout in themes (which then changes all files), not each page individually!
